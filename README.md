# Roll20 API Macros
This is a list of API Macros that I use in my Roll20 D&D 5e games. For each of the macros created there is a readme.md file that provides the purpose and requirements to run them. It also provides acknowledgement to the creators of each of the APIs. Thanks again to all the API Script creators for your contributions, they are greatly appreciated.
